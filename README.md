Unsupervised Learning with Autoencoders for Data Dimensionality Reduction
This project demonstrates the use of autoencoders, a class of neural networks, for dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised learning setting. Autoencoders are particularly useful for extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional data while preserving important information.

Overview:

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in preprocessing high-dimensional data to improve computational efficiency and enable better visualization. Autoencoders achieve this by compressing the input data into a smaller latent space and reconstructing it back to the original dimension.

This project implements:

Encoder: Maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional latent space.
Decoder: Reconstructs the original data from the latent space representation.
Dimensionality Reduction: The encoder's output provides a compressed, meaningful representation of the input data.
Key Features
Unsupervised Learning: Autoencoders learn without labeled data by minimizing the reconstruction loss between input and output.
Dimensionality Reduction: The latent space representation can be used for tasks like visualization, clustering, and as input for other machine learning models.
Customizable Architecture: You can adjust the size of the latent space and network layers to fit your dataset and task.

Use Case Example:

In this project, the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) is used to:

Compress the 28x28 images into a 64-dimensional latent space.
Reconstruct the original images from the reduced representation.
Visualize the compressed data in 2D using techniques like t-SNE.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Results
The autoencoder successfully reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining important features. For example:

Original and reconstructed MNIST images show minimal loss of quality.
Latent space representations provide a compact yet meaningful summary of the data.
Applications
Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction can be applied in:

Data compression: Reduce storage and memory requirements.
Feature extraction: Create meaningful features for downstream tasks.
Anomaly detection: Identify outliers based on reconstruction error.
Data visualization: Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
